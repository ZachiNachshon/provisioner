# Instructions in here - https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/

# The GitHub Actions used in these instructions pull source content from the
# master branch and then commit the generated content to the gh-pages branch.
# This applies regardless of what type of GitHub Pages you are using.
# This is a clean setup as your Hugo files are stored in one branch and
# your generated files are published into a separate branch.
