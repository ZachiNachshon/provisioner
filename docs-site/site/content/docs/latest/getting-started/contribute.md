## Tooling setup

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) `v3.10` is required for packaging and tests
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is optional for managing the documentation site

{{< callout info >}}
Docs site is using npm scripts to build the documentation and compile source files. The `package.json` houses these scripts which used for various docs development actions.

## Guidelines

- PRs need to have a clear description of the problem they are solving
- PRs should be small
- Code without tests is not accepted, PRs must not reduce tests coverage
- Contributions must not add additional dependencies
- Before creating a PR, make sure your code is well formatted, abstractions are named properly and design is simple
- In case your contribution can't comply with any of the above please start a GitHub issue for discussion

## How to Contribute?

## Testing Locally

This repository had been developed using the TDD methodology (Test Driven Development). Tests allow you to make sure your changes work as expected, don't break existing code and keeping code coverage high.

Running tests locally allows you to have short validation cycles instead of waiting for the PR status to complete.

**How to run a test suite?**

1. Clone the `provisioner` repository
2. Run `make tests-all` to use the locally installed Python interpreter
3. Alternatively, run `make test-coverage-xml-all` if you are interested in coverage reports

## Documentation Scripts

The `/docs-site/package.json` includes numerous tasks for developing the documentation site. Run `npm run` to see all the available npm scripts in your terminal. Primary tasks include:

{{< bs-table >}}
| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run docs-build` | Cleans the Hugo destination directory for a fresh serve |
| `npm run docs-serve` | Builds and runs the documentation locally |
{{< /bs-table >}}

## Local documentation 

Running the documentation locally requires the use of Hugo, which gets installed via the `hugo-bin` npm package. Hugo is a blazingly fast and quite extensible static site generator. Hereâ€™s how to get it started:

- Run through the [tooling setup](#tooling-setup) above to install all dependencies
- Navigate to `/docs-site` directory and run `npm install` to install local dependencies listed in `package.json`
- From `/docs-site` directory, run `npm run docs-serve` in the command line
- Open [http://localhost:9001/](http://localhost:9001/) in your browser

Learn more about using Hugo by reading its [documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

{{< callout info >}}
Makefile contains a `make docs-site` command that does all of the above for you, it allows a quick start of the documentation site.

## Troubleshooting

In case you encounter problems with missing dependencies, run `make clear-virtual-env-all` and start over.
